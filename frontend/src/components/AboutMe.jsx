                        I am a Computer Science & Engineering 
                        graduate with a strong interest in software development. 
                        During my studies and a web development internship, 
                        I worked on real-world projects, gained experience with multiple programming languages, 
                        and learned how to solve problems effectively while working in teams. 
                        Currently, Iâ€™m focused on growing my skills in the field of software development 
                        through continuous learning and hands-on practice. I am looking for an opportunity 
                        in a collaborative and modern environment where I can contribute, grow professionally, 
                        and take on new challenges.
